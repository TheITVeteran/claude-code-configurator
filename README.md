# Claude Code Configurator

An interactive CLI tool for configuring Claude Code projects.

## Overview

The Claude Code Configurator is a command-line interface tool that simplifies the process of setting up and managing Claude Code configurations in your projects. It provides an intuitive way to analyze your project components, recommend relevant agents and commands, and safely apply configurations.

## Features

- **Interactive CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use menu-driven interface for configuration selection
- **Component Analysis**: Parses your project's `components.json` to understand available agents, commands, MCPs, and hooks
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Context-aware suggestions for the most relevant components based on your project
- **Safe Configuration Management**: Automatically backs up existing configurations before making changes
- **Configuration History**: Tracks all configuration iterations for easy rollback and comparison

## Quick Start

**✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM** - The Claude Code Configurator makes setting up Claude Code effortless for new developers. Get your Claude Code environment configured with AI-powered recommendations in minutes, not hours.

**Current Status**: Production-ready with all core features working (5/6 stories complete, 83% done)

### Prerequisites

1. **Google API Key**: Set up your API key for AI-powered recommendations:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
   ```

2. **Components Definition**: Ensure you have a `components.json` file in your project root that defines available Claude Code components (agents, commands, MCPs, hooks).

### Installation & Usage

**For Local Development** (current setup):
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url]
cd claude-code-configurator/claude-config
npm install
npm run build

# Configure your Claude Code project
node bin/claude-config configure --project-dir /path/to/your/project

# Or use from your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project
/path/to/claude-config/claude-config/bin/claude-config configure
```

**Available Commands (ALL WORKING ✅):**
```bash
# Initialize or update configuration with AI recommendations
claude-config configure  ✅ WORKING

# Alternative commands (all run the same workflow)
claude-config init       ✅ WORKING - Initialize configuration
claude-config update     ✅ WORKING - Update existing configuration

# Backup and restore
claude-config reset      ✅ WORKING - Restore from previous backup
claude-config history    ✅ WORKING - View configuration history

# Help
claude-config --help     ✅ WORKING - Show all commands
claude-config --version  ✅ WORKING
```

### How It Works

1. **Intelligent Analysis**: The tool parses your `components.json` to understand all available Claude Code components
2. **Interactive Setup**: Answer simple questions about your project (languages, frameworks, complexity)
3. **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Google's Gemini AI analyzes your requirements and recommends the most relevant components
4. **Safe Configuration**: Automatically backs up existing `.claude` folder before making changes
5. **Instant Results**: Your Claude Code environment is configured and ready to use
6. **History Tracking**: All configurations are saved for future reference and comparison
