# Requirements Verification

## Original Request:
"Please help me create a simple MVP kiss system for automated configuration of claude code for my current project,
I want to be able to call "npx claude-config" and it will open up a cli interface like bmad-method installer, it will ask me what type of configuration i want currently for my project, and then it will search components.json, inside there are agents, commands, mcps, hooks

I want it to reason about my request and create a plan for all the agents i will need (there are 102 agents in the object)
Then tell it to get the 10 best agents,
Do this for agents, commands mcp's etc etc
And then after that i want it to bkp the current .claude folder in the current project, and then add the agents and commands etc etc to the .claude, i want it to save in the project a .configurator folder which there we will save the iterations we did and the agents we chose to the project, so we can change the agents occasionally

Please help me plan the features for this MVP"
