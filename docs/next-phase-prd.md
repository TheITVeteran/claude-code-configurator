# Product Requirements Document: CACI Next Phase
## CLAUDE.md Support and Predefined Workflows

---

## Executive Summary

CACI (Code Assistant Configuration Interface) has successfully achieved 100% completion of its core functionality. This PRD outlines the next phase focusing on two specific enhancements:
1. Support for CLAUDE.md file management
2. Installation of predefined workflows (BMad-Method and Claude workflows)

---

## Features

### 1. CLAUDE.md File Support

#### Problem Statement
Users need to configure project-specific instructions for Claude Code through CLAUDE.md files, but currently CACI only manages components in the .claude folder.

#### Solution
Extend CACI to manage CLAUDE.md files alongside component configurations.

#### Requirements
- **Detection**: Automatically detect existing CLAUDE.md files in project root
- **Backup**: Include CLAUDE.md in backup operations before modifications
- **Templates**: Provide CLAUDE.md templates for common project types
- **Merging**: Smart merging of existing CLAUDE.md content with new configurations
- **Validation**: Validate CLAUDE.md syntax and structure

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
interface ClaudeMdConfig {
  projectName: string;
  instructions: string[];
  conventions?: string[];
  filePatterns?: string[];
  customCommands?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

#### User Flow
1. Run `caci configure`
2. CACI detects existing CLAUDE.md
3. User selects to update or replace CLAUDE.md
4. CACI provides templates or AI-generated suggestions
5. CLAUDE.md is updated with project-specific instructions

---

### 2. Predefined Workflows Installation

#### Problem Statement
Users want to quickly install proven workflow configurations without manually selecting individual components.

#### Solution
Add predefined workflow bundles that can be installed with a single command.

#### Supported Workflows

##### 2.1 BMad-Method Workflow
Complete BMad (Business Method for Agile Development) setup including:
- **Agents**: PM, PO, Architect, Developer, QA, Analyst
- **Commands**: Story creation, documentation generation, project planning
- **Templates**: PRD, architecture docs, user stories
- **CLAUDE.md**: BMad-specific instructions and conventions

##### 2.2 Claude Standard Workflow
Optimized Claude Code configuration including:
- **Agents**: Code reviewer, documentation writer, test generator
- **Commands**: Common development tasks
- **Hooks**: Pre-commit, post-update validations
- **CLAUDE.md**: Best practices for Claude Code usage

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
interface WorkflowBundle {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  components: {
    agents: string[];
    commands: string[];
    hooks: string[];
    mcps: string[];
  };
  claudeMd?: ClaudeMdConfig;
  dependencies?: string[];
}
```

#### CLI Commands
```bash
# List available workflows
caci workflow list

# Install a workflow
caci workflow install bmad-method
caci workflow install claude-standard

# Preview workflow contents
caci workflow preview bmad-method
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
.claude/
  agents/
  commands/
  hooks/
  mcps/
CLAUDE.md              # Project instructions
.configurator/
  workflows/           # Predefined workflow definitions
    bmad-method.json
    claude-standard.json
```

### API Changes

#### New Methods
- `detectClaudeMd(): Promise<boolean>`
- `backupClaudeMd(): Promise<string>`
- `mergeClaudeMd(existing: string, template: string): string`
- `installWorkflow(workflowName: string): Promise<void>`
- `listWorkflows(): Promise<WorkflowBundle[]>`

---

## Success Criteria

1. **CLAUDE.md Support**
   - Successfully detect and backup existing CLAUDE.md files
   - Merge configurations without data loss
   - Provide at least 5 project-type templates

2. **Workflow Installation**
   - One-command installation of workflows
   - Both BMad-Method and Claude Standard workflows available
   - Clear preview of what will be installed
   - Rollback capability if needed

---
