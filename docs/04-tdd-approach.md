# Development Approach: TDD Implementation

## Overview
We'll implement the Claude Code Configurator using Test-Driven Development (TDD) following the stories we've created.

## TDD Cycle
For each story, we'll follow the TDD cycle:
1. Write a failing test for a small piece of functionality
2. Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. Refactor the code while keeping tests passing
4. Repeat until all functionality is implemented

## Implementation Order
1. **Story 1.1: Implement Core CLI Interface**
   - Set up Jest testing framework
   - Create CLI entry point
   - Implement command handling
   - Add error handling

2. **Story 1.2: Implement Component Analysis**
   - Create component parser
   - Implement requirement analysis
   - Develop ranking algorithm
   - Create recommendation display

3. **Story 1.3: Implement Configuration Management**
   - Implement backup functionality
   - Implement configuration application
   - Implement restore functionality

4. **Story 1.4: Implement Iteration Tracking**
   - Create iteration tracking functionality
   - Implement history viewing
   - Save component selections
   - Implement iteration comparison

## Quality Assurance
- All code will have unit tests with >90% coverage
- Code will follow TypeScript best practices
- All tests must pass before moving to next story
- Code will be reviewed before merging

## Tools
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- Inquirer.js for CLI prompts
- Commander.js for CLI parsing (if needed)
