## 🎯 Naming Standards Applied

### ✅ **Sequential Numbering**
- All files numbered for clear order and priority
- Numbers padded with leading zeros for proper sorting

### ✅ **Descriptive Names**
- Each file name clearly describes its content
- No ambiguous or vague terms
- Consistent naming conventions throughout

### ✅ **Hierarchical Organization**
- Parent folders contain related child documents
- Logical grouping of related files
- Clear progression from planning to implementation

### ✅ **Implementation Ready**
- Stories clearly numbered and named
- Each story folder contains implementation details
- Easy to follow development sequence

🎉 **All files now use clear, standardized naming that immediately indicates their purpose and content!** 🎉
