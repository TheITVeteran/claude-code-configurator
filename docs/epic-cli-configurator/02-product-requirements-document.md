# PRD: Claude Code Configurator MVP

## 1. Product Vision
A simple, intelligent CLI tool that automates the configuration of Claude Code projects by analyzing project requirements and intelligently selecting the most relevant agents, commands, MCPs, and hooks from a large pool of available components.

## 2. Problem Statement
Configuring Claude Code for projects is currently a manual, time-consuming process. With 102 available agents, developers face decision paralysis and often miss important components. The process lacks standardization and version control, making it difficult to reproduce configurations or track changes over time.

## 3. Solution Overview
An npm package (`claude-config`) that provides an interactive CLI interface to:
1. Analyze project requirements through guided questions
2. Intelligently recommend the best components from a large pool
3. Backup existing configurations before applying changes
4. Apply selected configurations to the project
5. Track configuration iterations for future reference

## 4. Target Users
- Claude Code users who want to quickly configure their projects
- Developers working with large component libraries
- Teams that need consistent configuration across projects
- Developers who prefer guided setup over manual configuration

## 5. User Stories

### Story 1: Initialize Configuration
As a Claude Code user, I want to run a simple command to start the configuration process, so that I can quickly begin setting up my project.

### Story 2: Requirement Analysis
As a developer, I want to answer guided questions about my project requirements, so that the system can intelligently recommend relevant components.

### Story 3: Component Selection
As a user, I want the system to analyze 102 available agents and recommend the 10 most relevant ones based on my requirements, so that I don't have to manually evaluate all options.

### Story 4: Configuration Backup
As a cautious developer, I want the system to backup my existing .claude folder before making changes, so that I can restore my previous configuration if needed.

### Story 5: Configuration Application
As a user, I want the selected components to be automatically applied to my project's .claude folder, so that I don't have to manually copy files.

### Story 6: Iteration Tracking
As a team member, I want the system to save configuration iterations in a .configurator folder, so that my team can track changes and understand configuration decisions.

### Story 7: Configuration Modification
As a user, I want to easily modify my configuration in the future, so that I can adapt to changing project requirements.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 CLI Interface
- Command: `npx claude-config`
- Interactive question-based interface
- Progress indicators
- Clear error messages

### 6.2 Component Analysis
- Parse components.json file
- Analyze agents, commands, MCPs, and hooks
- Rank components based on project requirements
- Select top 10 components for each category

### 6.3 Configuration Management
- Backup existing .claude folder
- Apply selected components to .claude folder
- Create .configurator folder for iteration tracking
- Save configuration decisions

### 6.4 Data Management
- Read components.json
- Write to .claude folder
- Manage .configurator folder
- Version configuration iterations

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Performance
- Configuration process should complete within 30 seconds
- Component analysis should be efficient even with 102+ agents

### 7.2 Reliability
- Backup must be created before any modifications
- Configuration application must be atomic (all or nothing)
- Error handling for file operations

### 7.3 Usability
- Simple, intuitive CLI interface
- Clear instructions and feedback
- Helpful error messages

### 7.4 Security
- No external network calls
- No collection of user data
- Safe file operations with proper permissions

## 8. Technical Requirements

### 8.1 Platform
- Node.js application
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- npm package distribution

### 8.2 Dependencies
- Minimal external dependencies
- No build tools required for end users

### 8.3 File Structure
- components.json parsing
- .claude folder management
- .configurator folder creation and management

## 9. Success Metrics
- Configuration time reduced from hours to minutes
- 90% user satisfaction with component recommendations
- Zero data loss incidents
- <5% configuration rollback rate

## 10. Out of Scope
- Cloud-based component repository
- GUI interface
- Automatic updates of components.json
- Integration with project dependency analysis
