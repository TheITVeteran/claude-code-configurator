# PRD: Simple Usage Analytics

## Overview
Add basic usage analytics to track how users interact with the Claude Code Configurator CLI tool.

## Problem
We don't know how users are using the tool, which features are popular, and where they might be encountering issues.

## Solution
Add simple analytics tracking for:
- Command usage (which commands are run)
- Feature usage (which configuration options are selected)
- Error tracking (when commands fail)
- Basic user flow (successful vs failed configurations)

## Requirements
- No personal data collection
- Simple opt-in mechanism
- Local storage of analytics data
- Anonymous usage statistics
- Easy to disable/enable

## Success Metrics
- Track basic usage patterns
- Identify popular features
- Detect common failure points
- Maintain user privacy
