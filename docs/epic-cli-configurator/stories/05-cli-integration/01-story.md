# Story 1.4: Implement CLI Tool Integration

## Status
Completed

## Story
As a Claude Code user, I want the CLI tool to work as a complete integrated system, so that I can configure my projects from start to finish using a single command.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System integrates all modules (analyzer, manager, tracker) into a cohesive CLI workflow
2. System provides a seamless user experience from project analysis to configuration application
3. System handles errors gracefully throughout the entire workflow
4. System provides clear feedback at each step of the process
5. System saves iteration history for each configuration run

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create main CLI workflow
  - [x] Integrate component analysis with user requirement collection
  - [x] Connect AI-powered component recommendation with configuration application
  - [x] Link configuration management with iteration tracking
  - [x] Handle workflow errors gracefully
- [x] Implement end-to-end user experience
  - [x] Create seamless transition between workflow steps
  - [x] Provide clear progress feedback throughout the process
  - [x] Show meaningful status messages at each stage
  - [x] Handle user interruptions gracefully
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling
  - [x] Handle missing components.json file
  - [x] Handle API key errors for AI recommendations
  - [x] Handle file operation errors during configuration application
  - [x] Handle iteration tracking errors
- [x] Implement iteration history saving
  - [x] Save each configuration run as an iteration
  - [x] Store selected components and user requirements for each iteration
  - [x] Provide access to previous iterations
  - [x] Handle iteration saving errors

## Dev Notes
### Implementation Approach
We'll be integrating all the existing modules (analyzer, manager, tracker) into a single cohesive CLI workflow that guides users through the entire configuration process from start to finish.

### Testing
- Test file location: tests/integration/
- Test standards: Jest integration tests for end-to-end workflow
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for integration testing
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test complete workflow from requirement collection to configuration application
