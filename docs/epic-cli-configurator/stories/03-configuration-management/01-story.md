# Story 1.3: Implement Configuration Management

## Status
In Progress

## Story
As a Claude Code user, I want the system to backup my existing configuration and apply new configurations safely, so that I can easily rollback if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System backs up existing .claude folder before making changes
2. System applies selected components to .claude folder
3. System handles file operations safely with proper error handling
4. System provides clear feedback on backup and apply operations
5. System can restore previous configurations

- [x] Implement backup functionality
  - [x] Check if .claude folder exists
  - [x] Create backup of existing .claude folder
  - [x] Handle backup errors (permissions, disk space, etc.)
  - [x] Provide progress feedback during backup
- [x] Implement configuration application
  - [x] Apply selected components to .claude folder
  - [x] Handle file operations safely
  - [x] Provide progress feedback during application
  - [x] Validate applied configuration
- [x] Implement restore functionality
  - [x] List available backups
  - [x] Restore selected backup
  - [x] Handle restore errors
  - [x] Provide progress feedback during restore

## Dev Notes
### Testing
- Test file location: tests/manager/
- Test standards: Jest unit tests for file operations
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit testing, mock file system for testing
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test with various file permission scenarios and edge cases
