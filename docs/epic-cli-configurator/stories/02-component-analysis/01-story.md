# Story 1.2: Implement Component Analysis

## Status
In Progress

## Story
As a Claude Code user, I want the system to intelligently recommend the best components for my project, so that I don't have to manually evaluate all 102 agents.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System can parse components.json file
2. System can analyze project requirements through user questions
3. System uses AI reasoning model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to recommend components based on project needs
4. System presents recommended components for each category
5. User can view detailed information about recommended components

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create component parser
  - [x] Implement JSON parsing for components.json
  - [x] Create data models for components
  - [x] Handle parsing errors gracefully
- [x] Implement requirement analysis
  - [x] Design question flow for gathering project requirements
  - [x] Implement interactive CLI prompts
  - [x] Store user responses
- [x] Implement AI-powered component recommendation
  - [x] Integrate with Gemini 2.5 Pro API via LangChain
  - [x] Create structured prompts for component selection
  - [x] Handle API errors gracefully
  - [x] Parse and validate AI responses
- [ ] Create recommendation display
  - [ ] Format component recommendations for CLI display
  - [ ] Show component details
  - [ ] Allow user to view more information

## Dev Notes
### Implementation Approach
We'll be using Gemini 2.5 Pro with structured outputs to intelligently recommend components based on user requirements. This approach will provide more accurate recommendations than a simple keyword matching algorithm.

### API Key Requirements
Users will need a GOOGLE_API_KEY to use this feature. They can obtain one from Google AI Studio:
1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/
2. Sign in with a Google account
3. Navigate to "API Keys" in the sidebar
4. Create a new API key
5. Set the key as an environment variable: `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

### Testing
- Test file location: tests/analyzer/
- Test standards: Jest unit tests for parsing and AI integration
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit testing
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test with various components.json structures and edge cases
- Mock the AI API calls during testing to avoid dependency on external services
