# Story 1.6: Implement Google Analytics Usage Tracking with Privacy-First Approach

## Status
Approved

## Story
As a product manager, I want to track usage patterns using Google Analytics 4 with a privacy-first approach, so that I can understand how users interact with the CLI tool and improve it based on actual usage data while respecting user privacy and providing full transparency and control over data collection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement Google Analytics 4 (GA4) integration using Measurement Protocol
- [ ] Add first-run consent prompt with clear explanation of data collection
- [ ] Track CLI command usage (configure, init, update, reset, history) anonymously
- [ ] Track feature selection during configuration workflow
- [ ] Track error types and success/failure rates without personal information
- [ ] Store user consent preference in local config file
- [ ] Provide CLI flag to enable/disable analytics at any time
- [ ] Include comprehensive privacy policy updates
- [ ] Anonymous data collection only (no personal identifiers)
- [ ] Easy opt-out mechanism accessible via CLI command
- [ ] Comply with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA compatible)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create Google Analytics integration module
  - [ ] Implement GA4 Measurement Protocol client
  - [ ] Create anonymous client ID generation
  - [ ] Add event tracking functions for CLI actions
  - [ ] Implement privacy-compliant data collection
- [ ] Add consent management system
  - [ ] Create first-run consent prompt with detailed explanation
  - [ ] Implement local consent storage in config file
  - [ ] Add consent status checking before any tracking
  - [ ] Create consent withdrawal mechanism
- [ ] Implement usage event tracking
  - [ ] Track CLI command execution (configure, init, update, reset, history)
  - [ ] Track feature selection during configuration workflow
  - [ ] Track error types and success/failure rates
  - [ ] Track configuration completion rates
  - [ ] Track component analysis results (anonymized)
- [ ] Add CLI analytics management commands
  - [ ] --enable-analytics flag for enabling tracking
  - [ ] --disable-analytics flag for disabling tracking
  - [ ] --analytics-status command to show current consent status
  - [ ] --withdraw-consent command for easy opt-out
- [ ] Privacy and documentation updates
  - [ ] Update README with privacy notice and analytics information
  - [ ] Create comprehensive privacy policy document
  - [ ] Add clear disclosure of all data collection practices
  - [ ] Document analytics opt-out procedures
  - [ ] Add analytics configuration section to user guide

## Dev Notes
### Technical Implementation Details
- Use Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol for server-to-server tracking
- Generate random UUID for anonymous client identification
- Store analytics preferences in ~/.claude-config/analytics-config.json
- All events must be anonymized (no file paths, usernames, or project names)
- Implement exponential backoff for GA API requests
- Add offline event queuing for network failures

### Privacy Compliance Requirements
- No collection of personal identifiable information (PII)
- No collection of file paths, project names, or user identifiers
- Anonymous error tracking (error types only, not full stack traces)
- Local consent storage only (no external consent management)
- Clear opt-out mechanism accessible at any time
- Transparent data collection disclosure

### Testing
- Test file location: tests/analytics/
- Test standards: Unit tests for analytics functions and consent management
- Testing frameworks: Jest
- Test scenarios: opt-in flow, data anonymization, consent withdrawal, offline queuing
- Mock GA4 API responses for testing
- Test privacy compliance (no PII in tracked events)

### Event Schema Design
```
Event Categories:
- cli_command: Track command usage
- configuration: Track feature selection
- error: Track anonymized error types
- completion: Track workflow completion rates

Event Properties (anonymized):
- command_type: Type of CLI command executed
- feature_selected: Configuration features chosen
- error_type: Category of error encountered
- completion_status: Success/failure status
- session_id: Anonymous session identifier
```
