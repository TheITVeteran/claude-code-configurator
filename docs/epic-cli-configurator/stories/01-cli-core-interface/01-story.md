# Story 1.1: Implement Core CLI Interface

## Status
Completed

## Story
As a Claude Code user, I want to run a simple command to start the configuration process, so that I can quickly begin setting up my project.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can run `npx caci` to start the CLI
2. CLI displays a welcome message
3. CLI shows available options (init, update, reset, help)
4. CLI handles invalid commands gracefully
5. CLI provides clear error messages

  - [x] Create executable script in bin/caci
  - [x] Set proper permissions for the script
  - [x] Implement basic command parsing
  - [x] Add help option
- [x] Implement welcome message functionality
  - [x] Display project name and version
  - [x] Show brief description of tool
  - [x] List available commands
- [x] Add command handling
  - [x] Implement init command
  - [x] Implement update command
  - [x] Implement reset command
  - [x] Implement help command
  - [x] Handle unknown commands
- [x] Implement error handling
  - [x] Handle missing components.json file
  - [x] Handle permission errors
  - [x] Handle invalid JSON in components.json
  - [x] Display user-friendly error messages

## Dev Notes
### Testing
- Test file location: tests/cli/
- Test standards: Jest unit tests for all CLI functionality
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit testing, Inquirer for CLI testing
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test all command options and error scenarios

The CLI interface has been implemented using Commander.js for parsing command line arguments. The implementation includes all the required commands (init, update, reset, help) and properly handles the case when no arguments are provided by displaying the help message.

Tests have been written using Jest to verify all functionality, and all tests are passing.

### Key Implementation Details
1. Created a CLI entry point script in bin/caci that references the compiled JavaScript file
2. Implemented command parsing using Commander.js
3. Added proper error handling for missing files and permission errors
4. Wrote comprehensive tests to verify all functionality
