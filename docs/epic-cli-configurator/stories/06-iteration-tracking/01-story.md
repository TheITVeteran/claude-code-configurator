# Story 1.5: Implement Iteration Tracking

## Status
In Progress

## Story
As a Claude Code user, I want the system to track my configuration iterations, so that I can understand my configuration history and make informed decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System creates .configurator folder in project
2. System saves configuration iterations with timestamps
3. System provides a way to view configuration history
4. System saves selected components for each iteration
5. System provides a way to compare different iterations

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create iteration tracking functionality
  - [x] Create .configurator folder
  - [x] Save configuration iterations with timestamps
  - [x] Handle iteration saving errors
- [x] Implement history viewing
  - [x] List saved iterations
  - [x] Show details of each iteration
  - [x] Handle history viewing errors
- [x] Save component selections
  - [x] Save selected components for each iteration
  - [x] Save user requirements for each iteration
  - [x] Handle component saving errors
- [x] Implement iteration comparison
  - [x] Compare different iterations
  - [x] Show differences in component selections
  - [x] Handle comparison errors

## Dev Notes
### Testing
- Test file location: tests/tracker/
- Test standards: Jest unit tests for tracking functionality
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit testing
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test with various iteration scenarios and edge cases
